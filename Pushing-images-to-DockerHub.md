Before following up with this process, we need to create a repository where we can store our images into DockerHub⤵️

### 📌 Navigate to dockerHub

## Step 1. Build and Tag Your Image Correctly 🖼️
#### ( I'll be showing you how to do this with a flask apllication but remember that this process can be done with any application)

-With the Dockerfile for my flask application, i can build that image and tag it with my DockerHub username and the repository name of my choice (In this case im going to use the repository i just created)

### The Command to do this is: ⤵️

( In my case its Dockerfile.2 because i created another Dockerfile for my apllication )

Then, run the command: ⤵️

And this should push your images to Dockerhub ready to be pulled or shared!!

  To pull the image down to another machine (or the same machine) all we need to do is run the command: ⤵️
