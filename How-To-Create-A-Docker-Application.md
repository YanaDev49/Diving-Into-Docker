## Creating My first Python Script!!
![PythonPoweredGIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c44680f3-767e-470f-98da-8d7a720fd156)

Making my first mini python stcript was definitely interesting yet challenging at the same time
since this was one of the first encounters ive had with the programming language and i needed to make sure i understood the basics 💡
So i did some research on the basics of Python and everything i needed to know for making a short but interactive script!!

Previously, i was learning about the nature of bash scripting and while understanding the basics of python, i recognised some concepts in both processes that caught my attention. Both python and bash scripting use variables to store all different types of data and they both use the '=' character to assign variables too!
The only difference is that in python, you have to use a space between the '=' character and the variable assigned and in bash you do not!

As you can see there is no space between the '=' along with the variable and its assignment!

You can see that a space between the variable and its assignment has to be put in place! 

Another quick similarity between both bash scripting and the python programming language is that they both use control structures like 'if', 'for', and 'while' loops.

The only difference is with the type of brackets they use and differing language types, E.g using ![image](https://github.com/user- attachments/assets/2cad277b-46a9-4072-945b-c0ca6e3f62ad) instead of ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/581f09d4-5651-4d5c-a6a3-bab90f079d0f)
