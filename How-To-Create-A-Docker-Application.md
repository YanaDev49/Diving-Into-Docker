## Creating My first Python Script!!
![PythonPoweredGIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c44680f3-767e-470f-98da-8d7a720fd156)

Making my first mini Python script was both interesting and challenging, as it was one of my first encounters with the programming language. I needed to ensure I understood the basics, so I did some research on Python fundamentals and everything necessary to create a short but interactive script!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d10ad6d5-324e-4bd6-8ac2-60480d71d09c)

Previously, I was learning about bash scripting, and while grasping the basics of Python, I noticed some concepts shared between the two that caught my attention. Both Python and bash scripting use variables to store different types of data, and both use the '=' character to assign values to variables.

The main difference is that in Python, you need to include a space between the '=' character and the value being assigned, whereas bash scripting does not require this adjustment!

## 𝗟𝗲𝘁 𝗺𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗮 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/badbba70-cc31-4f5b-9da1-974048f4522d)

As you can see there is no space between the '=' character along with the variable and its assignment!

You can see that a space between the variable and its assignment needs to be put in place! 

Another quick similarity between both bash scripting and the python programming language is that they both use control structures like 'if', 'for', and 'while' loops.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a000c38-66cb-474f-ac70-ba17c9e8c5bd)

The only visual difference is with the type of brackets used as well as the differing language types, E.g using 'echo' instead of using 'print' 

## Creating a python script that counts the number of characters in each string!! 🚀

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/453cd626-562e-4ca8-8185-5cdd36177711)

The 'input' function in python allows us to recieve a users input which is the interactive part of the script itself. This means that when we run the script, the text ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65010804-9619-4d67-8ccf-887c3b1cd01d) will show up, indicating that the user should type in a message! 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f6d0015-24af-4d28-9930-08b89b92ae95) 

In this part of the code, the 'len()' function counts the characters in a string, including spaces and punctuation. By passing the 'text' variable into the 'len()' function, the code counts the characters within the text provided by the user.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8c4236b-682d-4c34-9879-810ab7f15bca)

This is an extention to our script that specifies that the 'len ()' function should only count the alphabetical characters in a string. The '.isalpha()' function is what essentially does this for us!. 

This means that with this addition to the script, only the letters within the textnwill be counted meaning that spaces and punctuation will be dismissed.

𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗶𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 '𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗼, 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱', 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗵 𝗶𝘀 𝟭𝟯 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗹𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗵 𝗶𝘀 𝟭𝟬, 𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c432c30-caa5-40ca-a111-b4d86740f550)

Finally, this last part of the code will show the result to the user.

- The 'print' function in python, prints out text in the code.
  
- In this case, it will print the 'character_count' variable, which stores the result of the 'len()' function we used to count the characters.

So the first thing that i did in this process was install Docker on my computer using my vscode terminal! ⤵️

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c52d2110-2956-4069-bf18-5e7a126d410f)

Before beginning the installation process, it's important to update your packages to ensure you have access to the latest software versions, which include important bug fixes, security patches, and other improvements.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc31eca3-13e9-4d18-bb5b-1940a5be7869)

This is the command that gets the installation process for Docker going!!🔝

Now, All you need to do is verify that Docker has been installed correctly using this command:

- Run the 'docker pull python' command and this will download the official python Docker image from DockerHub to your local machine.
- This image includes a python enviroment that you can use to run Python applications inside Docker Containers.

- Using the 'vim' command, open the docker file.
- Give it the specific name 'Dockerfile', and you should see that when the file is saved, the docker icon appears beside it.

- We use the keyword 'FROM' to do this
- In our example, we are using the Python image, so we specify 'Python' as the image name and the 'latest' as the version tag.

- We use the 'COPY' command for this purpose.
- The first parameter, 'string-count-script.py', refers to the file on my computer that contains my python script
- The second parameter, '/', specifies the destination path in the image, placing the file in the root directory

- This is done using the keyword 'CMD'
- In my case, the command will run 'Python ./string-count-script.py', which executes our Python script.

## 𝖲𝗍𝖾𝗉 𝟦: 𝖨𝗍𝗌 𝗍𝗂𝗆𝖾 𝗍𝗈 𝖼𝗋𝖾𝖺𝗍𝖾 𝖺 𝖣𝗈𝖼𝗄𝖾𝗋 𝗂𝗆𝖺𝗀𝖾!!

After editing your Dockerfile, you need to run the command:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df259765-5a0f-4d6b-9351-98b5126152db)

This command builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it as 'python-test'.

## 𝖲𝗍𝖾𝗉 5: 𝖨𝗍𝗌 𝗍𝗂𝗆𝖾 𝗍𝗈 𝖱𝗎𝗇 𝗒𝗈𝗎𝗋 𝖣𝗈𝖼𝗄𝖾𝗋 𝗂𝗆𝖺𝗀𝖾!!

To wrap up this process, we need to run the command: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00ce4103-dc07-4a79-a650-bdecb8530aa6)

In my case, when running my Python script, this command resulted in an error and did not execute the script as I expected, leading me into a long and intensive troubleshooting process! 👀

To put it plainly, I spiralled into despair, thinking I had gone through the entire process of learning, understanding, and building, only for my containerised script not to run in the end! 😭

### 𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗶 𝗱𝗶𝗱𝗻𝘁 𝗴𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝘂𝗽 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲!

I began researching my issue and discovered that, since my Python script required user input, my container needed the appropriate flags to allow this input to pass through. As a result, every time my container attempted to launch the script, it would immediately exit!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ca3fcba-b227-44de-a81f-2e04fc892090)

I then came accross the 'docker run python-test' command with the '-it' option:
