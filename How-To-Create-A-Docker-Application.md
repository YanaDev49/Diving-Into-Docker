## Creating My first Python Script!!
![PythonPoweredGIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c44680f3-767e-470f-98da-8d7a720fd156)

Making my first mini python stcript was definitely interesting yet challenging at the same time
since this was one of the first encounters ive had with the programming language and i needed to make sure i understood the basics 💡
So i did some research on the basics of Python and everything i needed to know for making a short but interactive script!!

Previously, i was learning about the nature of bash scripting and while understanding the basics of python, i recognised some concepts in both processes that caught my attention. Both python and bash scripting use variables to store all different types of data and they both use the '=' character to assign variables too!

The only difference is that in python, you have put a space between the '=' character and the variable assigned however, Bash scripting does not require this further adjustment!

As you can see there is no space between the '=' along with the variable and its assignment!

You can see that a space between the variable and its assignment has to be put in place! 

Another quick similarity between both bash scripting and the python programming language is that they both use control structures like 'if', 'for', and 'while' loops.

𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝗻 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝗽𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 the 'if' statement.

The only visual difference is with the type of brackets used as well as  the differing language types, E.g using ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf121b4e-5b34-485d-8e91-05e8b17e34eb)
