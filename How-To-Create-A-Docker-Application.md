## Creating My first Python Script!!
![PythonPoweredGIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c44680f3-767e-470f-98da-8d7a720fd156)

Making my first mini python stcript was definitely interesting yet challenging at the same time
since this was one of the first encounters ive had with the programming language and i needed to make sure i understood the basics 💡
So i did some research on the basics of Python and everything i needed to know for making a short but interactive script!!

Previously, i was learning about the nature of bash scripting and while understanding the basics of python, i recognised some concepts in both processes
that caught my attention. Both python and bash scripting use variables to store all different types of data and they both use the '=' character to assign variables too!
The only difference is that in python, you have to use a space between the '=' character and the variable assigned and in bash you do not!

As you can see there is no space between the '=' variable and its assignment

You can see that a space between the variable and its assignment has to be put in place
