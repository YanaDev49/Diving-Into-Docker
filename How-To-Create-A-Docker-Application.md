## Creating My first Python Script!!
![PythonPoweredGIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c44680f3-767e-470f-98da-8d7a720fd156)

Making my first mini python stcript was definitely interesting yet challenging at the same time
since this was one of the first encounters ive had with the programming language and i needed to make sure i understood the basics
So i did some research on the basics of Python and everything i needed to know for making a short but interactive script!!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d10ad6d5-324e-4bd6-8ac2-60480d71d09c)

Previously, i was learning about the nature of bash scripting and while understanding the basics of python, i recognised some concepts in both processes that caught my attention. Both python and bash scripting use variables to store all different types of data and they both use the '=' character to assign variables too!

The only difference is that in python, you have put a space between the '=' character and the variable assigned however, Bash scripting does not require this further adjustment!

## 𝗟𝗲𝘁 𝗺𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗮 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/badbba70-cc31-4f5b-9da1-974048f4522d)

As you can see there is no space between the '=' along with the variable and its assignment!

You can see that a space between the variable and its assignment needs to be put in place! 

Another quick similarity between both bash scripting and the python programming language is that they both use control structures like 'if', 'for', and 'while' loops.

The only visual difference is with the type of brackets used as well as  the differing language types, E.g using 'echo' instead of using 'print'

### 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗜 𝗱𝗶𝗱 𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀!! 🚀

The 'input' function in python allows us to recieve a users input which is the interactive part of the script itself. This means that when we run the script, the text ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65010804-9619-4d67-8ccf-887c3b1cd01d) will show up, indicating that the user should type in a message! 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f6d0015-24af-4d28-9930-08b89b92ae95) 

In this part of the code, the function 'len ()' is what counts the characters in a string which also includes spaces and punctuation.
By adding the variable 'text' between the 'len ()' function directly makes the code count the characters within the text given by the users input.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8c4236b-682d-4c34-9879-810ab7f15bca)

This is an extention to our script that specifies that the 'len ()' function should only count the alphabetical characters in a string
The '.isalpha()' function is what essentially does this for us!. This means that with this addition to the script, only the letters within the text, the user inputs will be counted meaning that spaces and punctuation will be dismissed.

Finally, this last part of the code will show the result to the user.
The 'print' function in python, prints out text in the code. 
In this case it will print out the variable 'character_count' which contains the process of the 'len ()' function that we added to perform the character counting process.

So the first thing that i did in this process was install Docker on my computer using my vscode terminal! ⤵️

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c52d2110-2956-4069-bf18-5e7a126d410f)

Before the installation process its important to update your packages because it ensures that you have access to the lastest software versions that include important bug fixes, security patches etc.

This is the command that gets the installation process for Docker going!! 

All you need to do now is verify that Docker has been installed correctly using this command:

In the approach i took, i already created my python file before creating my docker file. This means that i set up my docker file beforehand and all i needed to do was edit the file according to my python file. I'll show you what i mean down below ⤵️

run the ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c8e1115-d04c-4092-9c89-654cccc3e8a2) command and this will download the official python Docker image from DockerHub to your local machine. This image includes a python enviroment that you can use to run Python applications inside Docker Containers.
