## Creating My first Python Script!!
![PythonPoweredGIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c44680f3-767e-470f-98da-8d7a720fd156)

Making my first mini python stcript was definitely interesting yet challenging at the same time
since this was one of the first encounters ive had with the programming language and i needed to make sure i understood the basics 💡
So i did some research on the basics of Python and everything i needed to know for making a short but interactive script!!

Previously, i was learning about the nature of bash scripting and while understanding the basics of python, i recognised some concepts in both processes that caught my attention. Both python and bash scripting use variables to store all different types of data and they both use the '=' character to assign variables too!

The only difference is that in python, you have put a space between the '=' character and the variable assigned however, Bash scripting does not require this further adjustment!

## 𝗟𝗲𝘁 𝗺𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗶𝗻 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁:

As you can see there is no space between the '=' along with the variable and its assignment!

You can see that a space between the variable and its assignment has to be put in place! 

Another quick similarity between both bash scripting and the python programming language is that they both use control structures like 'if', 'for', and 'while' loops.

The only visual difference is with the type of brackets used as well as  the differing language types, E.g using ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf121b4e-5b34-485d-8e91-05e8b17e34eb)

## Creating a python script that counts the number of characters in each string!! 🚀

The 'input' function in python allows us to recieve a users input which is the interactive part of the script itself. This means that when we run the script, the text ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65010804-9619-4d67-8ccf-887c3b1cd01d) will show up, indicating that the user should type in a message! 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f6d0015-24af-4d28-9930-08b89b92ae95) 

In this part of the code, the function 'len ()' is what counts the characters in a string which also includes spaces and punctuation.
By adding the variable 'text' between the 'len ()' function directly makes the code count the characters within the text given by the users input.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8c4236b-682d-4c34-9879-810ab7f15bca)

This is an extention to our script that specifies that the 'len ()' function should only count the alphabetical characters in a string
The '.isalpha()' function is what essentially does this for us!. This means that with this addition to the script, only the letters within the text, the user inputs will be counted meaning that spaces and punctuation will be dismissed.

𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗶𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 '𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗼, 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱', 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗵 𝗶𝘀 𝟭𝟯 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗹𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗵 𝗶𝘀 𝟭𝟬, 𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.

Finally, this last part of the code will show the result to the user.
The 'print' function in python, prints out text in the code. 
In this case it will print out the variable 'character_count' which contains the process of the 'len ()' function that we added to perform the character counting function.
