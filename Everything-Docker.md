My Understanding of Docker is that, it is a platform used to containerise applications to ensure that the application can be ran from any machine and so that it is portable with all the necessary appliances it needs to run. For example, while undergoing the process of containerising my python script, i noticed the importance of ensuring that my script was structured correctly in order to complete the containerisation process.

## A description of the Docker Objective 🤔

In A nutshell, Docker allows engineers/Developers to create isolated enviroments to deploy their application! It is an open platform for developing, shipping and running applications in containers. It simplifies the process of managing containers making it easier to deploy build and run application. These enviroments are known as containers which helps to import applications with all the necessary appliances (As we previously mentioned). This means that all you have to do is launch your container which will allow your application to run immediately.

## The Difference between Docker and virtual machines? 🤔🚀

Now this is a phenomenon that has to be addressed when discussing Docker and its attributes!!

Understanding the difference between Docker and virtual machines was definitely an interesting turning point coming from understanding the ubuntu VM and how that had its own way of operations.

The difference between Docker and a Virtual Machine is that Docker does not have a complete operating system to allow applications to function on. Instead Docker will only share the resources of a machine to another through a container where the application and its attributes resides.

Unlike virtual machines, docker containers shrae the host machines OS, making them more lightweight and faster to start. you canrun many containers on the same machine without consuming a lot of resources!!

## Why Is Docker so important? 🙌🚀

Overall, docker is important because it makes it easier to package, build and run applications regardless of where its being deployed. it provides a consistent enviroment for applications which allows them to reach their full potential when running. 

Docker solves the issue of when an application breaks down due to when its been moved from one local machachine to the next. This is usefull for engineers and developers because they can transport application from one place to another!

And that is the basis of Docker and containers and why we use them In DevOps!!
