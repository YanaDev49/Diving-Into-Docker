- Docker compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage, multi-container docker applications

- Docker compose offers a powerful and efficient way to manage multiple container docker appications. This means that you dont have to go through the rouble of stoping and starting containers one by one!

- It lets you define all your services in a single file and manage them collectively

## Key Components Of Docker Compose

One of the key components of Docker Compose is the '𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿-𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲.𝘆𝗺𝗹 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲'

- the .𝘆𝗺𝗹 file lists all the services your application needs, meaning that it will specify what image to use, which port to expose and how the containers should interact.

- One of Docker compose's key strengths is that you can stop, start and run containers all at the same time which highlights its 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆!!!

- Docker compose allows you to orchestrate your entire stack with minimal effort which can be done for example with the '𝗱𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 -𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝘂𝗽' command which brings up all the containers defined in your docker compose .𝘆𝗺𝗹 file
