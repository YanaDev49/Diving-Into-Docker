- Images are known as templates for creating containers. We can think og it as a snapshot
  of an application at a certain point in time (kind of like a git commit hehe 😄)

  - One important point to understand is that images are 𝒊𝒎𝒎𝒖𝒕𝒂𝒃𝒍𝒆
  - This means that they dont change once they are created unless you recreate
    the whole image
  - The immutibility ensures that the application runs consistently, no matter where its deployed.

    - Containers on the otherhand are running instances of images, which are snapshots of an application.
    - Contains are what actually runs your application. you can manipulate it, start, stop and modify them as needed!
