# Lets Take a closer look: What are Containers? 📦📦📦

Containers are essentially, light weight portable units for running applications That bundle an application
to its dependencies which ensures that it runs consistently accross different enviroments. So if you have an apllication and 
you want to ru every part of that application, the containers will include the code and runtime as well as the libraries that 
the apllication needs to run. Its important to note that because they are isolated, it runs the same on any enviroment. You would be able to run it on your laptop as well as someone else laptop and even a production enviroment!

So in this diagram, we can see that there are 2 applications inside 2 containers that are on top of a docker engine. The docker engine is what makes containerisation possible. It provides the enviroment to build and manage containers which means that without the docker engine, your containers will be of no use. Each container will have the application as well as all the binaries and functions it needs to run smoothly. This isolation ensures that each app consistently. As well as this, the hosts operating system is also aligned with the docker engine because, remember, whatever the hosts operating system may be (whether thats Linux, MacOS or windows) docker will adapt to it. Then we have the infrascructure which sits at the bottom of them all which is the virtual hardware where everything runs.

Its important to understand that although there is more than one application running on top of the docker engine. These applications are encapsulated and isolated in each container which prevents each application from interfering with eachother which creates efficiency and productivity for all applications. This is what makes the containers light weight because although the applications share the same docker engine and operating system.

In contrast with virtual machines which has its own operating system, Containers sit on top of the operating system which what makes them light weight and beneficial.

- Containers bundle one application will all its dependencies into a single portable unit
- This ensures that the applications run consistenly accross different enviromnets
- It provides isolation and improves resource efficiency
- By using containers you can streamline deployemnt processes, ensuring your applications are relaible and portable

And there you have it!!
