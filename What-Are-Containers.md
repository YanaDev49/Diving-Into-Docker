Containers are essentially, light weight portable units for running applications That bundle an application
to its dependencies which ensures that it runs consistently accross different enviroments. So if you have an apllication and 
you want to ru every part of that application, the containers will include the code and runtime as well as the libraries that 
the apllication needs to run. Its important to note that because they are isolated, it runs the same on any enviroment. You would be able to run it on your laptop as well as someone else laptop and even a production enviroment!

So in this diagram, we can see that there are 2 applications inside 2 containers that are on top of a docker engine. Each container will have the application as well as all the binaries and functions it needs to run smoothly. As well as this, the hosts operating system is also aligned with the docker engine because, remember, whatever the hosts operating system may be (whether thats Linux, MacOS or windows) docker will adapt to it. Then we have the infrascructure which sits at the bottom of them all which is the virtual hardware where everything runs.
