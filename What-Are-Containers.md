Containers are essentially, light weight portable units for running applications That bundle an application
to its dependencies which ensures that it runs consistently accross different enviroments. So if you have an apllication and 
you want to ru every part of that application, the containers will include the code and runtime as well as the libraries that 
the apllication needs to run. Its important to note that because they are isolated, it runs the same on any enviroment.
